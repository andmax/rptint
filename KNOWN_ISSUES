Issues:

    RPTINT is a research project under development, presenting several
    known problems.  The software source code available online is a
    recovered version and, as such, is not the latest revised version.
    We apologize for the inconvenience, but the RPTINT source code
    presented here should be used only to get ideas from rather than
    as a ready-to-run application.
