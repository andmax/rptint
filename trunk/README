Abstract:

We present a practical implementation of a cell projection algorithm
for interactive visualization of large volumetric data sets using
programmable graphics cards.  By taking advantage of the data
regularity, we can avoid computing some steps of the original
algorithm with no quality loss.  Furthermore, performance is increased
since more than half the processing time is dedicated only for
rendering.  We also provide two tools for better user interactivity,
one for transfer function editing and another for volume clipping.
Our algorithm generates high quality images at a rendering speed of
over 5.0 M Tet/s on current graphics hardware.

Instalation:

    RPTINT code was written and tested on Linux platform using OpenGL
    Easy Extension (GLee) for extension functions, OpenGL Utility
    Toolkit (GLUT) for interface functions and LCG Toolkit from
    LCG/COPPE/UFRJ.  To download and/or see more information about
    above dependencies see:

    GLee: http://www.opengl.org/sdk/libs/GLee
    GLUT: http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut
    LCG-Toolkit: http://code.google.com/p/lcgtk

    In order to proper compile the RPTINT code, the GLee and GLUT
    should be on a default include directory: GL/; and the LCG Toolkit
    should be in HOME/lcgtk.  The Makefile can be optionally edited to
    reflect specific configurations.

Usage:

    RPTINT program is designed to run using a GPU that supports OpenGL
    Shading language.  It has been tested on a nVidia GeForce 6800.

    Command line: ./rptint 'volume'

    RPTINT program searches by default a directory with volume
    information named: ../tet_offs/.  For example, run it by calling:

    $ ./rptint skull

    and it will search for: datasets/skull.raw.  Additionally, file
    named skull.tf will also be opened in the same directory.  If they
    don't exist, they will be computed and created.  The only required
    file is the volume itself: datasets/'volume'.raw.

File Formats:

    .raw   -   Regular volume file ( scalar samples in a grid )
    .tf    -   Transfer Function file
